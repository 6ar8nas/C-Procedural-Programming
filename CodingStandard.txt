File structurizing:
    Functions definitions that are related to the streams of Input and Output: workWithIO.c
    Functions definitions that are related to the main interface window/menu: workWithMenu.c
    Functions definitions that are related to the linked list: workWithList.c
    Functions declarations: main.h
    Globally used libraries: main.h
    User created data-types: main.h

Code style:
    Global variables:
        Usage is limited/forbidden.
        If used, start the variable with a capital letter.
    
    Return values:
        0 - the program has been terminated and completed its task successfully.
        -1 - there has been a non-treatable error. 

    Indentation and spacing: 
        One tab symbol for each nested block or braces
        A space between integers, operands, variables used and etc.
        An empty line between different coherent code segments.

    Usage of braces: 
        Correct:
            if(...)
            {
                ...
            }
            
        Wrong:
            if(...) {
                ...
            }
    
    Variable naming:
        Correct: toDoList
        Wrong: to_do_list

    Node data-type (and elements):
        struct Element;
            int data;
            struct Element *next;
    
    Commenting:
        Unclear variables, tasks and statements are commented.

    Documentation:
        Provide the documentation in a ReadMe.txt file.        
        
    Goto:
        Usage is limited/forbidden.

Makefile usage:
    make: create an .exe from the files in the folder
    make clear: delete all .o files in the folder created in the making of the executable application.

Implementing a new library:
    #ifndef NEWLIBRARYNAME_H

    #define NEWLIBRARYNAME_H
    #include "newlibraryname.h"

    #endif
